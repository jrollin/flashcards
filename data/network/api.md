## API architecture styles

* SOAP:
  Mature, comprehensive, XML-based
  Best for enterprise applications

* RESTful:
  Popular, easy-to-implement, HTTP methods
  Ideal for web services

* GraphQL:
  Query language, request specific data
  Reduces network overhead, faster responses

* gRPC:
  Modern, high-performance, Protocol Buffers
  Suitable for microservices architectures

* WebSocket:
  Real-time, bidirectional, persistent connections
  Perfect for low-latency data exchange

* Webhook:
  Event-driven, HTTP callbacks, asynchronous
  Notifies systems when events occur
