## What is INVEST model ?

A model with set of criteria used to create effective user stories

A well-written user story is concise, specific, and easy to understand.
Each element of the INVEST model is essential to creating an effective user story:

- Independent: A user story should be self-contained and not dependent on other user stories
- Negotiable: A user story should be negotiable, allowing for discussion and changes
- Valuable: A user story should deliver value to the user
- Estimable: You should be able to estimate the effort required for a user story
- Small: A user story should be small enough to be completed in one iteration
- Testable: A user story should be testable to ensure that it meets the users’ needs

## User Story convention ?

“As a [user], I want [goal/desire] so that [benefit],”

“As a” identifies the user or persona who has a need or requirement.
“I want” describes the user’s goal or desire.
“So that” explains the benefit or value that the user expects to receive.

## User Story with more user centric structure

Here’s an example structure for a user-focused user story:

As a [type of user], I want [a specific goal or task] so that [a reason or benefit for completing the goal or task].

As a customer, I want to be able to track my order status so that I can see when my package will arrive.

### Example 1 – user story for an e-commerce website

As a customer, I want to be able to filter my search results by price, brand, and category so that I can quickly find the products I’m interested in.

### Example 2 – user story for a mobile app

As a commuter, I want to be able to access real-time transit information, including bus and train schedules, so that I can plan my journey and avoid delays.

### Example 3 – user story for a social media platform

As a user, I want to be able to see the number of likes and comments on my posts so that I can gauge the popularity of my content and adjust my strategy accordingly.

### Example 4 – user story for a product management tool

As a product manager, I want to be able to assign tasks to team members, set due dates and priorities, and track progress so that I can ensure that products are completed on time and within budget.

### Example 5 – user story for a healthcare app

As a patient, I want to be able to schedule appointments with my healthcare provider, access my medical records, and receive notifications for upcoming appointments so that I can manage my health effectively.

## Common mistakes and pitfalls to avoid when working with user stories

- Writing epics instead of user stories : too large to be completed within a single sprint / to estimate
- Not focused on user
- Failing to include acceptance criteria
- Not prioritizing user stories
- Failing to collaborate

### Imprecise USer story with dependencies

“As a user, I want a search function so that I can find what I’m looking for,” is too broad and could be broken down into the following smaller, more specific stories:

- As a user, I want to be able to search for products by name so that I can find specific items quickly
- As a user, I want to be able to filter my search results by category, price, and other criteria so that I can narrow down my search
- As a user, I want to see suggested search terms as I type in the search box so that I can easily find what I’m looking for
- As a user, I want to be able to save my search results and return to them later so that I don’t have to repeat the search process

Another way to avoid dependencies is to make sure that each user story is focused on a single feature or requirement. If a story includes multiple requirements, it may be difficult to complete without depending on other stories.

## acceptance criteria

Acceptance criteria are important for several reasons:

- Clear expectations: Acceptance criteria define the expected outcome of a user story in clear, measurable terms. This helps the development team and stakeholders agree on what success looks like and ensures everyone is on the same page.
- Testable criteria: Acceptance criteria provide a clear set of testable criteria that the development team can use to verify that the story has been completed successfully.
- Quality assurance: Acceptance criteria provide a way to ensure that the product meets the required quality standards.
- Prioritization: Acceptance criteria help prioritize user stories by identifying the most important requirements and ensuring that they are met first.

## stakeholders

Here’s an overview of the key stakeholders in a project or product development and their roles:

- Management: Management stakeholders provide overall guidance, support, and resources for the product. They make high-level decisions, provide strategic direction, and ensure that the product aligns with organizational objectives. Management stakeholders play a crucial role in setting priorities and allocating resources.

## Techniques and tools for refining user stories

There are several techniques and tools available to help teams refine user stories effectively. Some of these are as follows:

- User story mapping: This technique helps the team visualize the user’s journey through the product and identify any gaps or inconsistencies in the user stories
- Story splitting: This involves breaking down large user stories into small, more manageable pieces that can be developed and delivered more quickly
- Planning Poker: This is a consensus-based estimation technique that helps the team estimate the effort required to complete each user story
- Online collaboration tools: Tools such as Trello, Jira, and Asana can be used to manage, prioritize, and refine user stories efficiently
